# Game-Hub

Game Hub is a React-based web application that allows users to explore a vast library of games sourced from the RAWG API. The app has been built using Vite as a build tool and Chakra UI for the design. Users can view a wide variety of games, explore their genres, and read more about each game in detail. The app also allows users to filter the games by genre and search for specific titles. With this app, users can easily discover new games and keep track of their favorites. The application is built using TypeScript and uses the powerful RAWG API to fetch game data.
